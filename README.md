## hk

Fast Heroku client.

### Overview

hk is a command line client to the Heroku runtime platform, designed to be as fast as possible.

### Motivation

**Fast as a feature**

	## version

	$ time heroku version >/dev/null
	real	0m1.813s

	$ time hk version >/dev/null
	real	0m0.016s

	## list

	$ time heroku list >/dev/null
	real	0m8.826s

	$ time hk list >/dev/null
	real  0m3.658s

**Focus on API**

We believe this is evidence that a first-class Heroku API trumps any particular client.

**Iterative Development**

A release mechanism was created for hk in the beginning: the binary updates
itself. This gives us confidence in iterative development, which we value
highly, because it gives us the ability to release very often knowing users will
see the updates in a timely manner.

**The power of Go**

hk demonstrates the power of the Go language, runtime, systems access, and
distribution story (a single, statically linked binary with no dependencies) which are all very appealing to Heroku.

**Unix**

Heroku loves Unix. This client should reflect that. Commands are single,
unhyphenated words that map to their unix ancestorsâ€™ names and flags where
applicable.
